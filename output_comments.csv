While I'm very sad for Asmon I feel he was quite lucky to have parents like his. I think there are a lot of cases these days where the child cuts their parent(s) off for trivial differences, but there are a lot of bad parents out there as well who do nothing to prepare their children for the world or life in general. Hell, sometimes the child is the one who gets cut off. I can tell that Asmon's dad had a huge part in shaping who he is today and I think that's something that will stick with his audience"

Real Life trumps terminally online 100% of the time. This was an easy one. Just spend time with those you love. Touch Grass.

No question it was easy to make the choice to leave you losers and be with his dad who he loves and cherishes. Yall are asmongold viewers come on lol. Every youtuber despises their own fans bc they see 99% of them as raging morons. Everyone's mom and dad? You only got the one."

The way Asmon said that he felt like it was his duty as a son to help his father with the chores and whatnot shows how great of a job AsmonPa did at raising Asmon.

Some of my favorite moments on the streams was when Asmon's dad would call in.  I had a tremendous amount of respect for him and his service to the country.

I'm so glad that we were all able to feel like we got to know him and what kind of man he was through the streams.

I lost my dad last year and it was definitely a tough thing to deal with so I can relate to how Asmon feels."

Well done you random internet strangers. Well done. 

Also, from the 1% ratio viewer here, I miss you. Ya...felt just as weird to write too. But it's the truth. You, Zach, don't need me to say this because common sense is something your hardass dad (I say that with a smile) instilled it in you but obviously, take all the time you need.

YOU will grow around this pain and YOU will expand. The pain? The pain will stay the same size. I say that for any of you strangers reading this because it's a truth that absolutely helped me and I hope it helps one of you if you need it. 

I thought this specific biblical teaching was apropos:
If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? (Hebrews 12:7)
Translation: Son, I was hard on you because that‚Äôs what fathers do ‚Äî discipline hurts now, but it builds the man you‚Äôll become."

It is a neuro-socio-cognitive condition which is still being actively studied, however the medical/scientific communities have determined it is always known to be fatal in all cases, with new research suggesting it may in fact be highly infectious and potentially transmittable to others, thus posing a significant risk to the public at large (although at this point we cannot be certain, of course).  But anyways, I just wanted to say:  while yes, it is true, I may indeed pray every day for it to somehow drastically accelerate the shortening of his lifespan, I nevertheless still want him to hear this before he is finally erased from existence permanently and the world is finally cleansed.

When someone tells someone God bless they are asking, hoping that the person in question will be blessed it's outside of them in the hands of the divine. It's not a projection of oneself! It is a care of another human going through hard times. 

What you are arguing is for yourself. Your own wants. This is pride. 

Final note the majority of the planet is and throughout history looked and deified a higher power! Since the dawn of time. 

But you...a child knows better. That's up to you.

Lastly... Try thinking of others and helping others and being kind and loving.. do that daily.. and you will find your life improves 10 fold!

If facing the awful things I have done in my life, acknowledging them with no excuses or curtain to hide behind, being broken by what I have done and asking Him for forgiveness. Setting my mind against my sins and temptations so that they do not rule my life makes me weak, I will take weak.

 If forgiving those who have hurt and scarred me in my life, to the point it no longer affects me and I can genuinely pray for their wellbeing makes me weak, I will take weak. If going to those people, showing them love and growing my relationship with them makes me weak, I will take weak.

If sitting before those I have harmed or offended in my life, looking them in the eye and telling them I am truly sorry for the hurt and pain I caused them makes me weak, I will take weak.

If while going through my day, praying for God to use and guide me and being prepared to truly answer that call in any way when called upon makes me weak, I will take weak.

If going to my knees in prayer, praying for healing and blessings for others that are sick or hurting. Putting my needs behind others and standing up for truth makes me weak, I will take weak.

If walking and growing with God, becoming less day by day, year by year of the man I was and more of the man He's shaping me to be. Kinder, more quick to forgive, slower to anger, quicker to listen and slower to speak, more loving and less judgemental of others. If that makes me weak, I will take weak.

Being forgiven when you know you don't deserve it. Accepting blessings when you know you have not earned them. Being freely loved in a way that removes your burdens, breaks your chains and makes you want to be a better person. If that makes me weak, I will take weak.

The truth I have found in my life is that on my own I am weak, but when Jesus walks with me, I am made strong!"

Jesus‚Äô death by crucifixion is undisputed among historians. The empty tomb, eyewitness claims, and transformation of the disciples (who went from hiding in fear to boldly dying for their belief) are hard to explain without a real resurrection.

2. Existence of Jesus Confirmed by Non-Christian Sources - Roman and Jewish historians (Tacitus, Josephus, Pliny the Younger) confirm Jesus lived, was crucified under Pilate, and had devoted followers. These are independent, non-biblical sources.

3. Cosmological Argument (Origin of the Universe). Everything that begins to exist has a cause. The universe began to exist (confirmed by science: Big Bang). Therefore, the universe has a cause outside of space, time, and matter ‚Üí consistent with God. 

4. Fine-Tuning of the Universe. The laws/constants of physics are so precisely balanced that even slight changes would make life impossible. This makes more sense if the universe was designed than if it‚Äôs just chance.

5. Moral Argument
	‚Ä¢	If objective moral values exist (e.g., ‚Äúmurdering children is always wrong‚Äù), they require a transcendent source. Without God, morality is just opinion, but we all act as if certain things are truly right or wrong."

So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, ‚ÄúThey have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.‚Äù So Peter went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb. Both of them were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying there, and the face cloth, which had been on Jesus‚Äô head, not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead. Then the disciples went back to their homes. But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb. And she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet. They said to her, ‚ÄúWoman, why are you weeping?‚Äù She said to them, ‚ÄúThey have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.‚Äù Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, ‚ÄúWoman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?‚Äù Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, ‚ÄúSir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.‚Äù Jesus said to her, ‚ÄúMary.‚Äù She turned and said to him in Aramaic, ‚ÄúRabboni!‚Äù (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, ‚ÄúDo not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, ‚ÄòI am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.‚Äô‚Äù Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, ‚ÄúI have seen the Lord‚Äù‚Äîand that he had said these things to her. On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, ‚ÄúPeace be with you.‚Äù When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, ‚ÄúPeace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you.‚Äù And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, ‚ÄúReceive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you withhold forgiveness from any, it is withheld.‚Äù Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, ‚ÄúWe have seen the Lord.‚Äù But he said to them, ‚ÄúUnless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe.‚Äù Eight days later, his disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, ‚ÄúPeace be with you.‚Äù Then he said to Thomas, ‚ÄúPut your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe.‚Äù Thomas answered him, ‚ÄúMy Lord and my God!‚Äù Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúHave you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.‚Äù Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name."

One of my clients literally none of their daughters or sisters come to visit her, her daughter (who I worked with in a restaurant about 15 years ago, so I know her) only lives up the road from her and never visits her, never helps her, doesn't even call.

and now he said losing his own dad was traumatic...

i mean im sorry for his loss, but its actually weird to see him like that after he constantly justified the gen0cide of a whole population.

he showed zero empathy towards them. 
He justifed erasing a whole society and punishing everyone, just because a part of them is evil. 

not everyone there wants war. Many dont want war but their own government is forcing it upon them.

i mean just look how many small kids and toddlers lost their lifes there.

i think he cant even fathom how it would feel to lose his whole family in a single day. (which indeed happens in that place)

maybe now he can use that feel of his own loss, to imagine how those people might feel.

To be brave, you must first admit your own vulnerability: the chance of failure, rejection, pain, or loss. Without that exposure, there is nothing real to overcome, and no true courage in the act.

If we were truly invulnerable, fear would have no meaning. That‚Äôs why vulnerability gives bravery its depth: courage is not just feeling fear, but recognizing the risks it points to and choosing to move forward anyway.

A good start is to read ""The Courage to Be"" by Paul Tillich.

It‚Äôs a classic in existential philosophy that explores the relationship between fear, anxiety, vulnerability, and what it really means to have courage in the face of life‚Äôs uncertainties. Tillich breaks down how our awareness of fragility and mortality shapes both our fears and our capacity for bravery."

he showed zero empathy towards them. 
He justifed erasing a whole society and punishing everyone, just because a part of them is evil. 

not everyone there wants war. Many dont want war but their own government is forcing it upon them.

And the angel of Yahweh appeared to him in a blazing fire from the midst of the bush; and he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, yet the bush was not consumed. So Moses said, ‚ÄúI must turn aside now and see this marvelous sight. Why is the bush not burned up?‚Äù And Yahweh saw that he turned aside to look, so God called to him from the midst of the bush and said, ‚ÄúMoses, Moses!‚Äù And he said, ‚ÄúHere I am.‚Äù Then He said, ‚ÄúDo not come near here. Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.‚Äù He said also, ‚ÄúI am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.‚Äù Then Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God. And Yahweh said, ‚ÄúI have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sufferings. ‚ÄúSo I have come down to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up from that land to a good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite. ‚ÄúSo now, behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to Me; and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians are oppressing them. ‚ÄúSo now, come and I will send you to Pharaoh, and so you shall bring My people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt.‚Äù But Moses said to God, ‚ÄúWho am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?‚Äù And He said, ‚ÄúCertainly I will be with you, and this shall be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God at this mountain.‚Äù Then Moses said to God, ‚ÄúBehold, I am about to come to the sons of Israel, and I will say to them, ‚ÄòThe God of your fathers has sent me to you.‚Äô And they will say to me, ‚ÄòWhat is His name?‚Äô What shall I say to them?‚Äù And God said to Moses, ‚ÄúI AM WHO I AM‚Äù; and He said, ‚ÄúThus you shall say to the sons of Israel, ‚ÄòI AM has sent me to you.‚Äô‚Äù And God furthermore said to Moses, ‚ÄúThus you shall say to the sons of Israel, ‚ÄòYahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.‚Äô This is My name forever, and this is My memorial-name from generation to generation. ‚ÄúGo and gather the elders of Israel together and say to them, ‚ÄòYahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, ‚ÄúI indeed care about you and what has been done to you in Egypt. ‚ÄúSo I said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey.‚Äù‚Äô ‚ÄúAnd they will listen to your voice; and you with the elders of Israel will come to the king of Egypt, and you all will say to him, ‚ÄòYahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. So now, please, let us go a three days‚Äô journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God.‚Äô ‚ÄúBut I know that the king of Egypt will not give you permission to go, except by a strong hand. ‚ÄúSo I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My wondrous deeds which I shall do in the midst of it; and after that he will let you go. ‚ÄúAnd I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians; and it shall be that when you go, you will not go empty. ‚ÄúBut every woman shall ask of her neighbor and of the woman who lives in her house, for articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing; and you will put them on your sons and daughters.

If there is no emotional connection, there is no emotional response.

Sharing something so personal takes courage, and your words painted a powerful portrait of love, loss, and responsibility.
Losing a parent is never easy, and the way you spoke about your father's final days and your relationship with him was both heartbreaking and beautiful. It reminded me of how important it is to cherish the time we have with those we love.
Thank you for letting us into that part of your life. I hope you find comfort in knowing that your story resonates with many of us, and that you're not alone in your grief.
Sending strength and peace your way."

As a long time viewer I can honestly say I‚Äôm proud to be a fan of both you and your father. It‚Äôs not every day we as men get to share in the level of transparency you‚Äôve been able to provide. 

The community that your father saw you cultivate is something I know he was extremely proud of you for. I am honoured to be part of this community. Where logic, reason and a sense of truth was always paramount in our sentiments. 

May you find peace with his passing. 

Lots of love all the way from Canada.

We're all unique, coming from different backgrounds and life experiences, but the life experience he shared with all of us cannot be compared to any other. Rather than being sad for the loss I feel we should celebrate who he was and the unintentional joy that he brought to many. Funny without even trying to be funny. Insightful and witty. Providing a relatable, ""IDGAF,"" opinion on many topics. You take your time dealing with everything you feel you need to take care of. Everyone will still be here, anticipating a ""going live"" alert, supporters and haters alike. I'm certain you won't read this, but I do want to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for sharing your father with the world and inspiring a generation of folks to reasonably not GAF about the petty BS and live every moment.

I lost my uncle a few years back. In his possession he had a 2007 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 numbered car with less than 3,000 miles on it. Original tires even damn near 20 years later in practically pristine condition. My brother bought it so we didn't lose it and I'm buying it from him. I regret the last things I said to him since I lashed out even though as I grew older I respected what he did for the family in taking care of my mother's father. 

Earlier this year I was going through something stressful and he came into my thoughts with all my regrets. When I got home I sat down and simply spoke the words I regretted I didn't say. I suggest you do the same when the time is right. 

In regards to visiting the Vietnam memorial I suggest you do so anyway to honor his memory. I'm sure he'll be with you in spirit along with your mom. 

Take care buddy."

When my family found out I actually quit my job moved back home and got to spend a year and a half with him BEST DECISION I EVER MADE as before there was a shot to do a stemcell transplant but his white bloods cells had to be at a certain level before the stemcell transplant and that took a year and a half before his body could take the 50/50 shot of working. I donated my stem cells which made him live an extra 3 months. But man did the chemo wreck him. He looked young for only being 59 after the chemo he looked like he aged 20 years went from loosing all his hair with very little gray hair to when it grew back was all grey. What got him in the end because they hit him with so much chemo to kill his immune system to replace it with mine using my stem cells left him wide open to a simple cold which turned to pneumonia and they had to intubated (life support) and a week later he passed.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs something that one truly gets over but it‚Äôs something that seems easier to manage as the days press forward. If I may say.. you should sit with it. Feel it. And let it happen. Let yourself feel for however long is necessary. But do not stay stuck in it. Life moves on. And that is what you must do as well. My condolences to you. Wishing your father safe journeys on the other side.

Was on intensive care for one week without any responses and died just when i visited him. As my mom and he werent married i was the only one being allowed in the room and it was just suffocating sitting there seeing the docs trying to do something but ultimately fail.

I hope you'll be driving this Dodge Challenger proudly for a long time, in his memory. I'm glad you're prosessing the loss pretty well, I think (the credit goes to your dad) he would have wanted you to handle it exactly this way and I think he prepared you to handle it this this way with his harsh but fair and down to earth upbringing and and his unorthodox approach to life which is what we all need in this world.

Well, my dad passed away 15 years ago, he's a good person, even he's in hospital, still worried of others, and kept apologize to us, but that's not his fault, sometimes I'm thinking, if he can be more selfish, take care more of himself, maybe he'll live longer, but if he did that, that's not my dad I know, he always cares of others, worried others more than himself, always trying to help others as much as he could.

Also he knew lots things, almost everything he can find way to solve all problems, and humor.

I'm not good at speaking, I only hope everything will be fine and nothing bad happens anymore, take care and hope everything will be fine."

It‚Äôs okay that you have those moments.

You‚Äôll have times when it feels like things are almost back to normal, and there will be times when it feels like the grief sweeps over and drowns you, and sometimes out or nowhere or over the silliest small things.  And that‚Äôs normal.  That‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs part of the grieving process."

There's something that doesn't prepare you for these kinds of things or the regrets that you have afterwards. Though he gave you something that is only yours. He gave you a lot of his personality his trust his moments his life.

There's a lot of regrets we can have in life about what we didn't do during life and I'm not going to say that you're wrong and feeling that That's not the right thing to say. 

What I will say is that you get the ability to share his memories. You get the ability to call the family members and let him know what type of life he had. As much as his story as his alone You are now the person who gets the carry on his legacy. As harsh as that may seem but you can do it with pride and love. This doesn't get easier if you're going to become more capacity to be able to help others in this situation as time goes on. So in giving to others in this kind of situation when they're going through that you'll be able to help them more.
